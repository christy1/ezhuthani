Malayalam Unicode Editor - Malayalam Phonetic Keyboard

This is an Independent fork/ adaptation of 'Lekhana' by IIITMK, Trivandrum.

Lekhana was developed by us while at IIITMK Trivandrum and we would like to modify it and provide a improved tool for the world to write malayalam freely.

Requirements
You may have to install wxmac using homebrew if you are using ezhuthani on a Mac (OSX)
    brew install wxmac

On Linux install python-wxtools
